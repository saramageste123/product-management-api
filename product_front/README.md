# Product Management Frontend

Frontend application developed with **Angular** to consume the **Product Management API**.

The project simulates the interface of a real-world product management system, similar to those used in inventory management platforms, internal admin dashboards, and e-commerce product control panels.

The project focuses on:
* Scalable Angular architecture
* Component reusability
* REST API integration
* Clean UI organization
* Maintainability and code readability


## 🔍 Overview

The application provides a complete frontend interface for product management operations, including:

* Product management operations
* Dynamic pagination and sorting
* Product search by name
* Bulk product deletion
* Notifications management
* Low stock notifications
* Promotions management
* Product image support via URL
* Side navigation menu
* About/Profile section
* Reusable modal components

The frontend was designed using a feature-based architecture, allowing easier scalability, maintenance, and integration with backend services.

Additionally, the project communicates with a Java Spring Boot REST API, maintaining a decoupled architecture between frontend and backend layers.


## 🚀 Features

* Product listing
* Product creation
* Product editing
* Product deletion
* Bulk product deletion
* Product search by name
* Dynamic pagination and sorting
* Side navigation menu
* Notifications management
* Low stock notification support
* Promotions management
* About/Profile section
* Reusable modal components
* Loading state handling
* Request error handling
* REST API integration
* Component-based architecture organization


## 🧱 Project Architecture

The project follows a feature-based architecture, organizing related files by business domain.

```
src/app 
│ 
├── features/products 
│ 
├── about-me              → Profile/About section 
├── confirmation-modal    → Confirm/cancel action modal 
├── enums                 → Application enums 
├── models                → Interfaces and data models 
├── notifications         → Notifications feature 
├── product-card          → Product card component 
├── product-list          → Product listing 
├── product-modal         → Create/Edit product modal 
├── promotions            → Promotions feature  
├── service               → API communication layer 
└── side-menu             → Side navigation menu

```


This architecture provides:
* Better feature isolation
* Easier maintenance
* Component reusability
* Cleaner scalability for future modules
